0.02 --> 3.44
Hey Vsauce! Michael here. Down here.

4.84 --> 7.54
But which way is down?

7.74 --> 14.42
And how much does down weigh? Well, down weighs about a hundredth of a gram per cubic centimeter.

14.68 --> 20.06
It is light and airy which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for water birds

20.24 --> 22.38
but if you let go of down...

22.94 --> 24.84
It falls down.

25.04 --> 26.58
So that's which way down is.

26.68 --> 28.96
It's the direction gravity is pulling everything in.

29.24 --> 32.92
Now, for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up.

33.1 --> 38.42
But where are falling things going? Why do things fall?

38.52 --> 43.68000000000001
Are they being pushed, or pulled, or is it because of time travel?

44.4 --> 48.46
First things first: let's turn the Sun into a black hole.

49.14 --> 55
We can do that using universe sandbox 2, this simulator will blow your mind. I love it.

55.04 --> 59.379999999999995
In fact, I love it so much I put a code to get the game for free in the current curiosity box.

59.38 --> 62.18
If you're not subscribed to the box yet, you are missing out!

62.2 --> 66.24000000000001
Okay, look, for the purposes of this video, we want the solar system.

66.24 --> 70.41999999999999
And here it is. Notice that everything's moving pretty quickly around the Sun.

70.44 --> 74.72
That's because we currently have the game set so that every second that passes for us,

74.72 --> 77.22
is 14 days, almost, in the game.

77.22 --> 80.74
If I change this to one second,

80.74 --> 83.28
We're looking at the solar system in real time.

83.58 --> 85.88
You'll notice that it almost looks like it's frozen.

86.42 --> 91.6
even though the earth is traveling around the Sun at about 30 km/s, it barely appears to be moving.

91.76 --> 95.64
That is how vast space is. Anyway, let's go back to 14 days

95.66 --> 97.56
I like that motion. Now look at the Sun

97.57 --> 103.25899999999999
It is not, currently, a black hole, but we can change that. What we need to do is compress the Sun.

103.39 --> 108.72
So let's lock its mass so that it doesn't change while we make its radius smaller.

109.299 --> 111.959
Let's make its radius as small as we can.

112.58 --> 118.86
And, oh, where'd it go? Well it's still there, it's just become a black hole.

119.14 --> 123.44
Pretty spooky, but now, let's look at the rest of the solar system.

123.54 --> 126.819
Alright, zooming out and-

126.819 --> 127.959
huh.

127.96 --> 131.12
Nothing's... changed. I mean something's changed.

131.24 --> 136
It's colder and darker, but nothing's flying off into space or getting sucked in.

136.26 --> 140.34
You see,  by shrinking the sun, we didn't change the direction of down for the planets.

140.34 --> 145.739
They're always being pulled by gravity towards its middle and making it smaller didn't move where the middle was.

145.92 --> 151.79999999999998
But also, the strength of that force pulling them to the middle of the sun stayed the same.

152.26 --> 155.42
That gives us a clue as to what down is.

155.62 --> 159.98000000000002
The clue is the other thing we didn't change: mass.

160.26 --> 165.2
Mass is a measure of how hard it is to accelerate something; to change its motion.

165.46 --> 169.4
Now right now, these two balls have zero motion relative to me.

170.26 --> 172.56
Slapping around this hollow plastic ball

174.34 --> 178.109
is pretty easy, but doing the same to this solid steel ball

181.42 --> 182.67999999999998
is a lot harder.

183.12 --> 185.94
Now gravity and weight have nothing to do with this.

186.48 --> 190.28
Gravity acts downward, not against my horizontal slapping.

190.28 --> 196.4
Of course, gravity does contribute to friction, but friction works against me when I start moving the ball,

196.599 --> 199.018
but works with me when I stop the ball.

199.019 --> 202.739
And the steel ball is harder to stop than the plastic ball.

203.079 --> 207.149
The difference is mass. The steel ball is more massive

207.149 --> 210.94
It's more resistant to having its motion changed.

210.94 --> 216.7
Mass is an intrinsic property; it does not depend on what's around or change from place to place.

216.7 --> 220.61999999999998
It can sometimes be thought of as the amount of matter something has.

220.62 --> 223.96
Your mass is the same regardless of where you are.

223.96 --> 227.76000000000002
On the moon, on earth, in the middle of intergalactic space floating around.

228 --> 233.3
But all of this said, mass does seem to care about what's around.

233.82 --> 236.35999999999999
Mass loves company.

237.16 --> 243.35999999999999
Things with mass and/or energy are attracted together by a force that we call gravity.

243.609 --> 248.18900000000002
The feeling of gravity is just you and the earth being attracted to one another.

248.64 --> 253.11999999999998
Now every portion of an object with mass attracts other portions towards it.

253.48 --> 258.86
The average of all this pulling is an attraction between centers of mass.

259.02 --> 266.5
Giant things like Earth exert an obvious pull, but everything does. Even a baseball.

266.58 --> 272.21999999999997
These two baseballs are attracted together by their own gravities.

276.16 --> 282.92
Except their masses are so small, the force is minuscule, and it can't overcome friction or push air out of the way.

283.24 --> 284.889
They're never gonna come together

284.889 --> 291.809
But if you put two baseballs one meter apart in the middle of empty space where no other forces could act on them

292.03 --> 296.57899999999995
They would literally fall together and collide.

297.13 --> 300.539
It would take three days to happen, but it would.

301.599 --> 307.43899999999996
Isaac Newton found that the strength of the force bringing two things together is equal to the product of their masses

308.32 --> 315.389
Divided by the distance between their centers of mass squared times big G, the gravitational constant.

315.789 --> 320.789
If you make one of two objects more massive, or move them closer together, the force will be

321.01 --> 325.379
Stronger and this force of attraction is what we call weight

326.05 --> 330.27000000000004
So mass is intrinsic whereas weight depends on what's around

331.46 --> 335.13899999999995
Now a weird thing happens when you weigh yourself on most scales

335.42 --> 339.52000000000004
Weight is a force but scales display pounds or kilograms

339.65 --> 342.93899999999996
Which are units of mass what's going on?

342.94 --> 344.84
Is that a scale is

344.84 --> 346.7
activated by a force?

346.7 --> 347.289
Any force.

347.29 --> 351.999
It doesn't have to be caused by gravity. The scale then displays what amount of mass

352.25 --> 357.31
Near the surface of the earth would be attracted to the earth with the force. It's detecting

357.95 --> 363.81899999999996
Now since scales tend to be used on the surface of the earth by people on which the only force acting is gravity

364.04 --> 371.469
They tend to not be very far off, but they can be easily tricked and they further lead to the confusion between mass and weight

372.95 --> 380.289
Notice that weight is mutual. You are pulled down by earth with the same force that you pull up on earth.

380.84 --> 383.25899999999996
According to a scale I weigh

383.99 --> 385.99
180 pounds on earth

390.76 --> 395.43
And the earth weighs 180 pounds on me

396.7 --> 400.89
but because the Earth's mass is so much greater than my own and

401.56 --> 406.53000000000003
Because the more massive something is the more it resists being moved our

406.81 --> 410.73
Equal and opposite weight forces accelerate me a lot more than the earth

411.16 --> 418.589
If you drop a pencil from a height of 6 feet the pencil doesn't just fall to the earth more precisely

418.87 --> 420.87
They both come together.

421.27 --> 423.719
They're attracted to each other by equal forces

423.72 --> 426.02900000000005
but the same force moves the pencil a

426.25 --> 431.369
Lot more than the earth when you let go of the pencil the earth is literally pulled up

431.44 --> 436.89
To the pencil by the pencils own gravity a distance equal to about 9 trillion

437.47 --> 439.65000000000003
the width of a proton. That

440.17 --> 445.11
same force moves the pencil the remaining distance, which is still pretty much six feet

446.59 --> 452.21999999999997
At the height of the International Space Station's orbit you and earth are attracted about

453.07 --> 459.15
10% less than when you're on the surface about eight point eight times your mass but not zero

459.82 --> 466.679
for this reason weightless astronauts in zero gravity are neither weightless nor in zero gravity

467.47 --> 471.72
their weight force fails to bring them and earth together because they move horizontally

471.97 --> 477.69000000000005
So quickly that they fall. Just as fast as Earth's surface curves away from them and

478.3 --> 482.759
Even though they're experiencing 90 percent of the gravity you and I are feeling right now

483.19 --> 484.75
That's why they don't just fly away

484.75 --> 491.88
There are no forces called g-forces to resist their weight since everything around them is falling too

492.31 --> 496.17
It's resistance to your weight force stress

497.08 --> 503.18899999999996
Deformation that is needed for you to feel weight what astronauts in orbit actually lack is

504.13 --> 506.13
apparent weight

506.35 --> 509.46000000000004
likewise a helium balloon has weight

509.46 --> 515.299
I mean, it's made out of matter it clearly has mass so it's attracted to the earth

516.029 --> 518.119
Let's try to measure its weight force

521.01 --> 523.01
That's eight

523.979 --> 526.759
Okay it has negative apparent weight

526.89 --> 532.58
That's because its attraction to the earth is weaker than the buoyant forces from the air around it that push it up

532.86 --> 534.5
Now while it moves up

534.5 --> 541.7
It pushes air molecules down, but they transfer that force widely. Not just directly down onto the scale

542.279 --> 547.369
Buoyant forces are caused by the fact that whenever you are immersed in a fluid like water or air

548.19 --> 550.7600000000001
Molecules lower down are at greater pressure

550.98 --> 553.3100000000001
That are being pressed by the weight of all the molecules

553.44 --> 558.469
Above them and are closer to earth so they're pulled to it with a stronger force now having greater pressure

558.57 --> 561.7090000000001
Means they pack a bigger punch when they collide with things.

562.26 --> 563.459
So

563.459 --> 565.549
horizontally those collisions cancel out

565.62 --> 572.239
But vertically the stronger collisions from below went out providing lift a buoyant force

572.55 --> 578.4789999999999
This even happens on your own body across its surface area air lifts you with the force of about one

578.61 --> 585.589
Newton which is equal to the weight force of an apple so if you weighed yourself in a vacuum you would weigh about

585.839 --> 587.839
this much more

588.27 --> 594.679
But that's not all Earth's spin causes it to bulge at the equator so the closer you are to it

594.68 --> 601.76
The further you are from Earth's center of mass and the less your actual gravitational weight will be down is

602.1 --> 604.19
Always changing, I mean

604.29 --> 611.029
where is Earth's center of mass? It would always be the same as Earth's geometric middle if Earth's

611.25 --> 618.38
composition was uniform, but earth contains pockets of massive rock at different depths water mountains

618.38 --> 623.779
It's got moving changing insides and air and seasonal ice and though they're far away

624.24 --> 630.799
Gravity extends forever from everything so the moon the Sun the planets all of them pull on you

631.709 --> 632.8199999999999
negligibly,

632.82 --> 639.2890000000001
But truly. You weigh about a millionth of your weight less when the moon is directly above you

639.66 --> 646.74
This chunky shifting balance of material on earth and ever where else in the universe means that down is

647.2 --> 648.25
always

648.25 --> 650.849
changing on top of that Earth's spin

651.1 --> 656.82
Skews what you consider the direction of down away from its center of mass because the push you get from Earth's spin

657.04 --> 661.4399999999999
Seems to slightly lift you reducing your apparent weight and bending down

661.93 --> 663.31
towards the equator

663.31 --> 670.5
The net result is an apparent weight reduction at the equator of about half of a percent if a scale guesses your mass must be

670.93 --> 674.039
200 pounds at the poles it'll guess that you're

674.769 --> 678.239
199 at the equator. The 9.8

678.31 --> 684.6899999999999
Multiplier used so often in physics is calculated based on how these factors affect someone at 45 degrees latitude

685.209 --> 690.419
all of these influences on the direction of down result in a total vertical deflection.

690.82 --> 694.769
That's only ever at most a few arc seconds anywhere on earth

695.05 --> 701.8199999999999
That's not enough to be felt, but changes in direction and strength can be used to study the shape of the seafloor

702.43 --> 707.37
Determine what's under you or even help you discover ancient buried rooms?

708.399 --> 713.969
Point is all of our downs aren't a bunch of radially symmetric lines

714.579 --> 717.029
Down is an uncombed mess.

717.55 --> 723.24
Now since solids don't flow they can have shapes that don't pay much mind to this but water can

723.64 --> 731.249
Flow so ignoring influences like wind and tides the surface of oceans and lakes and puddles is always perpendicular

731.38 --> 737.07
To down if water could pass through land, or if earth were submerged in water

737.86 --> 741.419
Gravity would be the same everywhere along its bumpy surface

741.79 --> 746.25
Such a surface is called a geoid and can be drawn at any altitude

746.709 --> 752.459
If you wanted to build a table that completely enclosed the earth it would have to have rolling undulation

752.459 --> 755.3389999999999
Z' nearly 100 meters at some points in order to be

755.89 --> 759.629
Level so that a ball placed anywhere on it wouldn't roll

760.24 --> 763.62
Here is Earth's G. I exaggerated a thousand times

764.11 --> 768.1800000000001
You'd weigh about a hundredth of a percent less a few grams here?

768.18 --> 773.909
Then you would say here where gravity is a bit stronger point is the strength and direction

774.259 --> 778.7280000000001
Down is variable by location and changes over time

779.489 --> 784.279
So down is a fluctuating vector easy enough except?

784.739 --> 788.539
Why should matter attract matter in the first place?

789.54 --> 793.759
Isaac Newton was able to describe attraction, but not explain it

794.369 --> 799.369
humanity got closer however when Albert Einstein introduced his general theory of relativity

800.639 --> 803.988
Einstein thought a lot about the fact that everything falls to the ground

804.329 --> 806.5079999999999
At the same rate no matter

806.509 --> 813.1080000000001
How massive something is when dropped it will accelerate towards the earth down gaining about 9.8

813.109 --> 817.249
Meters per second for every second that it falls. That means that a hammer

817.589 --> 824.628
That's quite massive, and a not so massive feather when dropped from the same height will hit the ground at the same time

827.819 --> 829.819
Okay, what just happened...

830.279 --> 831.989
was an \\"air\\"ror.

831.989 --> 833.039
awkward laugh

833.039 --> 836.389
In order to fall through air a thing has to push air out of the way

836.549 --> 841.759
But if it has a large surface area and a low weight force it will have a lot of air to move

841.889 --> 847.279
But won't be able to move that air very quickly. In a vacuum, things do fall at the same rate regardless

847.46 --> 852.94
Of mass. This was famously demonstrated by Apollo 15 commander David Scott on the moon

854.04 --> 858.66
And I'll, uh, drop the two of them here and hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time.

860.28 --> 861.26
How 'bout that?

861.26 --> 866.34
That's weird right? I mean if a more massive object is pulled with a greater force

867.149 --> 870.589
Shouldn't it fall faster? Well Newton's explanation was simple:

871.41 --> 874.16
Larger masses are attracted with greater forces

874.589 --> 879.4380000000001
But will also require more force to be accelerated the same as a less massive thing

879.899 --> 886.008
Something a hundred times more massive might require a hundred times the force, but it will be pulled by gravity

886.769 --> 891.769
100 times more so everything falls to earth at the same rate

892.499 --> 894.499
What a fun coincidence right?

896.97 --> 898.739
Maybe not

898.739 --> 902.749
Einstein realized that there's another way for things to appear to fall together

903.889 --> 905.399
of their masses

905.399 --> 912.888
Imagine a feather and a hammer floating in space in a room if the room is suddenly accelerated up at 9.8

913.319 --> 918.079
M/s^2 the feather and the hammer will hit the floor at the same time

918.72 --> 924.3190000000001
furthermore whether it's the room coming up to meet them or gravity being suddenly switched on

924.66 --> 927.919
Neither object will feel any force pushing them

928.079 --> 933.318
There's no way to tell which of these happen. This is Einstein's famous

934.019 --> 935.399
equivalence principle

935.399 --> 939.618
He once admitted that his greatest thought ever was that of a man

940.439 --> 942.439
falling off of a roof

942.629 --> 948.558
While falling the man would not feel any forces on him even though. He's speeding up

949.529 --> 950.91
freefall is

950.91 --> 957.29
Indistinguishable from floating alone in space from having no forces on you from not being moved

957.689 --> 963.558
What if gravity isn't a force at all what if things fall not because they're being pushed or pulled

963.809 --> 967.789
But because they're not being pushed or pull

968.1 --> 972.619
To see how this could be we need to talk about straight lines

973.649 --> 977.388
What I have here is a retractable ID badge holder

977.489 --> 980.2090000000001
This is a great way to test for straight paths

980.699 --> 984.168
Because the string is always kept taut the card

984.169 --> 986.749
I have behind has two lines drawn on it

986.749 --> 992.058
And if while I pull the string out it always stays between those two lines

992.059 --> 994.459
I will know that I never turned

994.86 --> 1000.6990000000001
While I pulled it because any turn will translate into a different angle between the lines on the card and the string

1000.949 --> 1007.178
Now if I put two of these on a flat table and pull them out, always ensuring that they go straight ahead

1007.399 --> 1015.128
They will never meet. They will be forever parallel, but now let's put them on a sphere a curved surface

1015.799 --> 1022.119
Again, I pull both strings forward making sure that they always are pulled out straight. No turning

1023.059 --> 1025.059
Wait they came together

1026.13 --> 1028.3090000000002
Well, they didn't turn look

1028.71 --> 1035.8400000000001
Maybe there's some kind of weird force that pulled my hands together and just like gravity. I didn't feel it, but it happened

1036.39 --> 1037.5600000000002
No

1037.56 --> 1042.44
What happened was not the result of a force it was just a natural result of?

1043.14 --> 1049.97
Curvature you might be thinking wait a second are those really straight lines. I mean they don't look that straight to me

1050.64 --> 1057.5
Also, what if they've just moved along latitude lines then they've never come together and those look pretty darn straight

1058.44 --> 1065.509
But they're not a straight line never turns and although latitude lines look straight at first glance

1066.27 --> 1068.27
following one requires

1068.28 --> 1074.149
Turning to find straight line paths on surfaces whether they're flat like this or curved

1074.33 --> 1078.319
I love the written text now you can use an actual ribbon

1078.32 --> 1084.1689999999999
But I have found that a strip of paper works. Even better. Let's take a look at this path right here

1084.48 --> 1090.319
It's straight at first, but then it curves now if two people are traveling along this curve

1090.32 --> 1096.08
And they want to stay together the person on the inside will have to cover a shorter distance than the person on the outside

1096.99 --> 1100.429
Since both sides of this strip of paper cannot change their lengths

1100.43 --> 1105.409
They'll help us find a straight path if the strip of paper can lay flat

1105.6 --> 1108.889
We'll know that we have found a straight line and as you can see

1109.23 --> 1112.789
The strip can lay flat and follow the straight part of this path

1112.89 --> 1116.15
But when it comes to the curve in order to follow the path now

1116.34 --> 1120.1689999999999
The strip well it has too much material on the inside and that material

1120.33 --> 1126.4089999999999
Bunches up and leaves the plane therefore we know that this part of the path is not straight

1127.77 --> 1132.199
Let's use the ribbon test to find straight lines on the surface of a cone

1132.66 --> 1138.8890000000001
Well from the looks of it aligned directly from the base to the tip seems like it would be straight and sure enough

1138.93 --> 1144.199
Yeah, the ribbon lays flat on that path, but what about a ring around the cone?

1145.08 --> 1151.46
Nope doesn't work shorter distances around nearer the tip of the cone mean that there's too much ribbon up at the top

1151.46 --> 1153.18
So doesn't lay flat

1153.18 --> 1159.469
Let's see what else is there though besides this well if I start here and just allow the ribbon

1160.92 --> 1162.69
to lay flat

1162.69 --> 1166.3700000000001
Huh I get a little curvy looking shape like this

1166.429 --> 1172.759
I say curvy looking because while to someone say at the base this path might seem to go up

1173.19 --> 1179.78
Slow down change direction and then fall down faster and faster since a ribbon on such a path is flat

1179.94 --> 1183.53
It's actually for inhabitants on the cones surface

1184.11 --> 1188.059
Perfectly straight if we trace the ribbons path on to the cone

1188.059 --> 1195.139
We can see this clearly because a cone can be flattened a straight line on a curved surface is called a geodesic

1196.53 --> 1200.9289999999999
Here is a geodesic on a sphere the Equator is one

1201.51 --> 1205.369
Here's another a line of latitude is not a geodesic

1205.37 --> 1209.4789999999998
It's not a straight line to see why let's try to follow it with the ribbon you

1210.09 --> 1213.1399999999999
Know what I have to keep kind of lifting it

1213.33 --> 1217.4289999999999
Yeah, see distances around the sphere becomes shorter as we go up

1217.5 --> 1219.8
So there's too much material on the ribbon up here

1219.8 --> 1224.629
and it leaves the surface this path contains turns and in order to turn a

1224.76 --> 1227.749
Force has to act on you if no forces

1227.75 --> 1234.619
Did this is the path you would take notice that the ribbon begins moving due east, but then falls

1235.35 --> 1237.35
south

1237.39 --> 1239.39
Falls

1239.94 --> 1244.55
Einstein realized that curvature could cause things to be seemingly attracted to one another

1245.07 --> 1248.72
Without needing to invent the existence of forces like gravity

1249.09 --> 1256.1889999999999
but attraction only happens if things move along the surface if they stay still they

1256.59 --> 1262.37
Well, they don't come together so for something at rest. How does falling begin?

1262.37 --> 1267.9199999999998
I mean the thing has to move in this direction, but it's at rest right well

1267.99 --> 1268.49
Yes

1268.49 --> 1274.189
But it's only at rest in space and that's not the whole story up down

1274.65 --> 1282.469
Forward backward and left-right are all you need to describe where an event occur but a complete description will also need to describe

1283.32 --> 1288.559
When together these four dimensions form the setting in which everything in our universe happens

1290.28 --> 1291.66
Space-time

1291.66 --> 1298.7900000000002
Since we can talk about a falling pencil using just one spatial dimension up and down we can use a piece of paper to model

1299.01 --> 1303.109
Space-time for it. Okay, so we've got up and down, but we have to add another

1303.66 --> 1305.46
direction the pencil moves in

1305.46 --> 1306.3
time

1306.3 --> 1310.339
Now if no forces act on the pencil it won't move through space

1310.34 --> 1314.84
It will only get older and as you can see if all it does is get older

1314.84 --> 1320.03
It won't fall if space-time was flat when I let go of the pencil

1320.64 --> 1327.65
it wouldn't go anywhere, but now let's allow the earth which is massive to manipulate space-time into say a

1328.17 --> 1329.19
cone

1329.19 --> 1333.98
Now with no forces acting on it every part of the pencil follows a straight line

1334.08 --> 1340.61
But on a cone as we saw earlier such a path will look like this it will fall

1340.86 --> 1344.8999999999999
This is because distances around the cone are shorter higher up

1345.21 --> 1349.429
Time runs faster further from a massive object, but to go straight

1349.5 --> 1354.079
Not turn every part of the pencil must cover an equal distance in space-time

1354.63 --> 1356.19
like this

1356.19 --> 1363.29
Only when the pencil hits the earth does the repulsion of their mutual electrons provide a force pushing the pencil off a geodesic

1363.75 --> 1369.949
For the earth time is a series of slices from this evolution the pencils force-free

1370.259 --> 1377.869
Geodesic is why it falls not a push or pull just the pencils natural tendency to follow a straight line

1378.149 --> 1384.349
Until something acts on it now. We only used one dimension of space and one of time because

1384.87 --> 1391.639
Visualizing our universes three of space and one of time would take us beyond the limits of what could be shown on paper or screens

1392.1 --> 1393.389
but math

1393.389 --> 1395.1589999999999
Can take us there

1395.159 --> 1398.8090000000002
General relativity allows us to calculate how much mass and energy

1399.149 --> 1406.399
Curved space-time and has been used to explain things that Newton's older theory of falling as the result of

1406.649 --> 1414.378
Forces couldn't like anomalies in the orbit of mercury which orbits nearest the Sun and is therefore most affected by the sun's grip on

1414.84 --> 1421.309
space-time many other experiments have confirmed general relativity's picture of the universe fitting the conclusion that

1422.009 --> 1424.009
There is no

1424.62 --> 1426.62
Gravity there's just

1427.08 --> 1432.3999999999999
Space-time its curvature and a us in it. As John Wheeler famously put it

1432.96 --> 1439.76
Space-time grips mass telling it how to move mass grips space-time telling it how to curve?

1440.669 --> 1447.439
Relative to the earth we don't move very fast even jet airplanes move negligibly close to the speed of light

1447.6 --> 1450.589
So relative to earth we move almost

1450.96 --> 1457.549
Exclusively through time as such we are more affected by the way time is curved by mass

1457.74 --> 1459.659
Than how space is curved?

1459.659 --> 1464.8690000000001
This has led many to claim that for the most part you feel as though you're being pushed into the ground

1465.24 --> 1467.419
Not because of a force called gravity

1467.519 --> 1473.449
But because time is moving faster for your head than for your feet down is

1473.759 --> 1481.249
Relative and always changing, but it exists because of and is always in the direction of slower time

1481.98 --> 1485.839
Bertrand Russell called this the law of cosmic laziness

1486.69 --> 1493.759
Everything is naturally steered towards where time is slowest we call this falling

1494.429 --> 1496.429
going down

1496.53 --> 1499.849
So you don't have to keep anything on the down-low

1500.58 --> 1503.6889999999999
time will take care of that for you and

1504.75 --> 1506.49
and as always

1506.49 --> 1508.49
