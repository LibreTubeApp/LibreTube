Down here.</text><text start="4.84" dur="2.7">But which way is down?</text><text start="7.74" dur="6.68">And how much does down weigh? Well, down weighs about a hundredth of a gram per cubic centimeter.</text><text start="14.68" dur="5.38">It is light and airy which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for water birds</text><text start="20.24" dur="2.14">but if you let go of down...</text><text start="22.94" dur="1.9">It falls down.</text><text start="25.04" dur="1.54">So that&#39;s which way down is.</text><text start="26.68" dur="2.28">It&#39;s the direction gravity is pulling everything in.</text><text start="29.24" dur="3.68">Now, for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up.</text><text start="33.1" dur="5.32">But where are falling things going? Why do things fall?</text><text start="38.52" dur="5.16">Are they being pushed, or pulled, or is it because of time travel?</text><text start="44.4" dur="4.06">First things first: let&#39;s turn the Sun into a black hole.</text><text start="49.14" dur="5.86">We can do that using universe sandbox 2, this simulator will blow your mind. I love it.</text><text start="55.04" dur="4.34">In fact, I love it so much I put a code to get the game for free in the current curiosity box.</text><text start="59.38" dur="2.8">If you&#39;re not subscribed to the box yet, you are missing out!</text><text start="62.2" dur="4.04">Okay, look, for the purposes of this video, we want the solar system.</text><text start="66.24" dur="4.18">And here it is. Notice that everything&#39;s moving pretty quickly around the Sun.</text><text start="70.44" dur="4.28">That&#39;s because we currently have the game set so that every second that passes for us,</text><text start="74.72" dur="2.5">is 14 days, almost, in the game.</text><text start="77.22" dur="3.52">If I change this to one second,</text><text start="80.74" dur="2.54">We&#39;re looking at the solar system in real time.</text><text start="83.58" dur="2.3">You&#39;ll notice that it almost looks like it&#39;s frozen.</text><text start="86.42" dur="5.18">even though the earth is traveling around the Sun at about 30 km/s, it barely appears to be moving.</text><text start="91.76" dur="3.88">That is how vast space is. Anyway, let&#39;s go back to 14 days</text><text start="95.66" dur="1.9">I like that motion. Now look at the Sun</text><text start="97.57" dur="5.689">It is not, currently, a black hole, but we can change that. What we need to do is compress the Sun.</text><text start="103.39" dur="5.33">So let&#39;s lock its mass so that it doesn&#39;t change while we make its radius smaller.</text><text start="109.299" dur="2.66">Let&#39;s make its radius as small as we can.</text><text start="112.58" dur="6.28">And, oh, where&#39;d it go? Well it&#39;s still there, it&#39;s just become a black hole.</text><text start="119.14" dur="4.3">Pretty spooky, but now, let&#39;s look at the rest of the solar system.</text><text start="123.54" dur="3.279">Alright, zooming out and-</text><text start="126.819" dur="1.14">huh.</text><text start="127.96" dur="3.16">Nothing&#39;s... changed. I mean something&#39;s changed.</text><text start="131.24" dur="4.76">It&#39;s colder and darker, but nothing&#39;s flying off into space or getting sucked in.</text><text start="136.26" dur="4.08">You see,  by shrinking the sun, we didn&#39;t change the direction of down for the planets.</text><text start="140.34" dur="5.399">They&#39;re always being pulled by gravity towards its middle and making it smaller didn&#39;t move where the middle was.</text><text start="145.92" dur="5.88">But also, the strength of that force pulling them to the middle of the sun stayed the same.</text><text start="152.26" dur="3.16">That gives us a clue as to what down is.</text><text start="155.62" dur="4.36">The clue is the other thing we didn&#39;t change: mass.</text><text start="160.26" dur="4.94">Mass is a measure of how hard it is to accelerate something; to change its motion.</text><text start="165.46" dur="3.94">Now right now, these two balls have zero motion relative to me.</text><text start="170.26" dur="2.3">Slapping around this hollow plastic ball</text><text start="174.34" dur="3.769">is pretty easy, but doing the same to this solid steel ball</text><text start="181.42" dur="1.26">is a lot harder.</text><text start="183.12" dur="2.82">Now gravity and weight have nothing to do with this.</text><text start="186.48" dur="3.8">Gravity acts downward, not against my horizontal slapping.</text><text start="190.28" dur="6.12">Of course, gravity does contribute to friction, but friction works against me when I start moving the ball,</text><text start="196.599" dur="2.419">but works with me when I stop the ball.</text><text start="199.019" dur="3.72">And the steel ball is harder to stop than the plastic ball.</text><text start="203.079" dur="4.07">The difference is mass. The steel ball is more massive</text><text start="207.149" dur="3.791">It&#39;s more resistant to having its motion changed.</text><text start="210.94" dur="5.76">Mass is an intrinsic property; it does not depend on what&#39;s around or change from place to place.</text><text start="216.7" dur="3.92">It can sometimes be thought of as the amount of matter something has.</text><text start="220.62" dur="3.34">Your mass is the same regardless of where you are.</text><text start="223.96" dur="3.8">On the moon, on earth, in the middle of intergalactic space floating around.</text><text start="228" dur="5.3">But all of this said, mass does seem to care about what&#39;s around.</text><text start="233.82" dur="2.54">Mass loves company.</text><text start="237.16" dur="6.2">Things with mass and/or energy are attracted together by a force that we call gravity.</text><text start="243.609" dur="4.58">The feeling of gravity is just you and the earth being attracted to one another.</text><text start="248.64" dur="4.48">Now every portion of an object with mass attracts other portions towards it.</text><text start="253.48" dur="5.38">The average of all this pulling is an attraction between centers of mass.</text><text start="259.02" dur="7.48">Giant things like Earth exert an obvious pull, but everything does. Even a baseball.</text><text start="266.58" dur="5.64">These two baseballs are attracted together by their own gravities.</text><text start="276.16" dur="6.76">Except their masses are so small, the force is minuscule, and it can&#39;t overcome friction or push air out of the way.</text><text start="283.24" dur="1.649">They&#39;re never gonna come together</text><text start="284.889" dur="6.92">But if you put two baseballs one meter apart in the middle of empty space where no other forces could act on them</text><text start="292.03" dur="4.549">They would literally fall together and collide.</text><text start="297.13" dur="3.409">It would take three days to happen, but it would.</text><text start="301.599" dur="5.84">Isaac Newton found that the strength of the force bringing two things together is equal to the product of their masses</text><text start="308.32" dur="7.069">Divided by the distance between their centers of mass squared times big G, the gravitational constant.</text><text start="315.789" dur="5">If you make one of two objects more massive, or move them closer together, the force will be</text><text start="321.01" dur="4.369">Stronger and this force of attraction is what we call weight</text><text start="326.05" dur="4.22">So mass is intrinsic whereas weight depends on what&#39;s around</text><text start="331.46" dur="3.679">Now a weird thing happens when you weigh yourself on most scales</text><text start="335.42" dur="4.1">Weight is a force but scales display pounds or kilograms</text><text start="339.65" dur="3.289">Which are units of mass what&#39;s going on?</text><text start="342.94" dur="1.9">Is that a scale is</text><text start="344.84" dur="1.86">activated by a force?</text><text start="346.7" dur="0.589">Any force.</text><text start="347.29" dur="4.709">It doesn&#39;t have to be caused by gravity.
